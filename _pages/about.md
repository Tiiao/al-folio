I am a Research Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://www.ttic.edu'>Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a>.
I am broadly interested in various aspects of statistics and machine learning theory.

Prior to TTIC, I received my Ph.D. from the <a href='https://statistics.yale.edu'>Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at Yale University, where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href='http://www.stat.yale.edu/~zf59'>Zhou Fan</a>.
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in mathematics with a dual degree in computer science at University of Science and Technology of China.

**In July 2025, I will join <a href="https://datascience.ucsd.edu">the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute</a> at UC San Diego as a tenure-track Assistant Professor.**
